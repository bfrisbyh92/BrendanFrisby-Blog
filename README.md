## Tech Blog

### Brendan Frisby 2022

##### I am creating a blog to cover topics I'm interested in because I think other people may be interested also. I'm naturally curious and get into all different types of tools for Hacking, Termux hacking, Penetration testing, Social Engineering, and much more. Anything that peaks my interest I learn as much as possible about. I plan to share that with others, or maybe only document it myself with the options for others to view, who knows but it's worth a try. I can use it to look back at how to utilize different tools, or use them together, because face it nobody remembers everything they learn down the line. To be able to use this as a sort of notes of my own experimentation and use of different tools will be nice also. Whatever it turns out to be, This is my blog in the making.
