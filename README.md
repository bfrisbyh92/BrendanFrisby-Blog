## Tech Blog

### Brendan Frisby 2022

##### I am creating a blog to cover topics I'm interested in because I think other people may be interested also. I'm naturally curious and get into all different types of tools for Hacking, Termux hacking, Penetration testing, Social Engineering, and much more. Anything I can think of, that peaks my interest, I get into thoroughly and learn as much as possible. I plan to share that with others, or maybe only document it myself with the options for others to view, who knows but it's worth a shot.
